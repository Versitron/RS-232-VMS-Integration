## [RS-232 VMS Integration](https://www.versitron.com/products/rs-232-circuit-card-serial-data-to-fiber-converter)  
Versitron’s **RS-232 VMS integration** solutions allow legacy control systems, such as PTZ controllers and alarm panels, to interface with modern Video Management Software (VMS). By extending RS-232 signals over fiber or Ethernet, operators can centralize camera control, automate alerts, and ensure interoperability between analog infrastructure and IP-based platforms.

This integration is critical for upgrading older installations in transportation hubs, prisons, or border control facilities while maintaining reliable and secure camera operation.

## [IP Camera to RS-530 Converter](https://www.versitron.com/products/industrial-fiber-optic-micromodems-m62xxd)  
The **IP camera to RS-530 converter** enables interfacing between modern IP surveillance cameras and legacy systems that still use RS-530 serial protocols. Versitron’s solution acts as a protocol bridge or media converter, allowing video control, positioning data, or telemetry signals to be passed between devices seamlessly.

It is ideal for military bases, industrial zones, and government buildings transitioning from serial to IP-based security without replacing core infrastructure.
